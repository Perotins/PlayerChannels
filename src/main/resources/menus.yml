# The following file is to give YOU the power to decorate the menus within PrivateTalk however you would like.

# This file is sorted by section of items, some sections appear in menus with other sections. It is not by inventory.
# NOTE: Only what appears in the default config can be configured. Do not try to add config keys where they do not already exist
# For getting materials, use this: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html


# Global items that will be used in multiple places:
deco-item:
   display: ""
   material: "BLACK_STAINED_GLASS_PANE"
# Navigation-bar items
# This is the row that appears at the top of most menus displaying things like player-profile, and create a chatroom

player-profile-head:
   slot: 4
   display: "&e$name$"
